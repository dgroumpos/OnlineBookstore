# OnlineBookstore

This project is a microservices-based implementation of an online bookstore. Each service is designed to handle a specific aspect of the system, ensuring scalability, resilience, and maintainability. The architecture uses modern software design patterns and technologies to create a robust and flexible system.

---

## **Services Overview**

### **1. Catalog Service**
**Purpose:** Manage books, authors, and genres.  
**Responsibilities:**
- CRUD operations for books, authors, and genres.
- Search and filter books.  
**Design Patterns:** Repository, Factory, DTO (Data Transfer Object).  
**Technology Stack:** ASP.NET Core Web API, Entity Framework Core.

---

### **2. Order Service**
**Purpose:** Handle orders and transactions.  
**Responsibilities:**
- Create and manage customer orders.
- Validate stock availability.
- Process payments (delegated to the Payment Service).  
**Design Patterns:** Saga, Unit of Work, Factory.  
**Technology Stack:** ASP.NET Core Web API, SQL Database.

---

### **3. Payment Service**
**Purpose:** Process payments for orders.  
**Responsibilities:**
- Integrate with multiple payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal).
- Handle payment confirmation and refunds.  
**Design Patterns:** Strategy (for different payment gateways), Singleton (shared configuration or clients).  
**Technology Stack:** ASP.NET Core Web API.

---

### **4. User Service**
**Purpose:** Manage user accounts and authentication.  
**Responsibilities:**
- User registration, login, and profile management.
- JWT-based authentication.  
**Design Patterns:** Singleton, Facade.  
**Technology Stack:** ASP.NET Core Identity, JWT.

---

### **5. Notification Service**
**Purpose:** Send notifications (email, SMS) to users.  
**Responsibilities:**
- Notify users about order status updates.
- Send promotional messages.  
**Design Patterns:** Observer, Strategy.  
**Technology Stack:** ASP.NET Core Background Services, SignalR (optional for real-time notifications).

---

### **6. API Gateway**
**Purpose:** Centralized entry point for clients.  
**Responsibilities:**
- Route requests to appropriate microservices.
- Handle authentication and rate limiting.  
**Design Patterns:** API Gateway, Proxy.  
**Technology Stack:** Ocelot API Gateway or YARP.

---

## **Infrastructure**

### **Service Communication**
- **Synchronous:** REST or gRPC for inter-service communication.
- **Asynchronous:** RabbitMQ or Kafka for event-driven architecture.

### **Database Per Service**
- Catalog Service → SQL Server.
- Order Service → PostgreSQL.
- Payment Service → NoSQL (if storing transactional logs).

### **Deployment**
- **Containerization:** Docker for service isolation.
- **Orchestration:** Kubernetes for automated deployment, scaling, and management.

### **Monitoring and Logging**
- **Stack:** ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Prometheus and Grafana.
- **Distributed Tracing:** Implemented with Jaeger or Zipkin.

---

## **Workflow Example**

### **Place an Order:**
1. The user browses books via the Catalog Service (through the API Gateway).
2. The Order Service creates an order and reserves stock in the Catalog Service.
3. The Payment Service processes the payment.
4. The Notification Service informs the user of the order status.

### **Event-Driven Architecture:**
- When a new order is created, an event is published to a message broker.
- The Payment Service subscribes to the event and processes the payment.
- Upon successful payment, another event is published to update the order status and notify the user.

---

## **Advantages of Microservices Architecture**
- **Scalability:** Scale individual services independently based on traffic demands.
- **Resilience:** Failures in one service do not impact the entire system.
- **Technology Independence:** Use the most appropriate technology for each service.

---

## **Technologies and Patterns**
### **Technologies:**
- **Backend:** ASP.NET Core Web API, Entity Framework Core, RabbitMQ/Kafka, Docker, Kubernetes.
- **Database:** SQL Server, PostgreSQL, NoSQL.
- **Authentication:** ASP.NET Core Identity, JWT.
- **Monitoring:** ELK Stack, Prometheus, Grafana.
- **Messaging:** RabbitMQ, Kafka.
- **Real-Time Notifications:** SignalR (optional).

### **Design Patterns:**
- Repository, Factory, DTO.
- Saga, Unit of Work.
- Strategy, Singleton, Observer.
- API Gateway, Proxy.
